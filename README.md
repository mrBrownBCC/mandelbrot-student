# p5js-mandelbrot

### Javascript vs Java
For this project, the code you are writing will look very very similar to java. Loops, if statements, returns, mathmatical expressions are all the same. 

The one thing to keep in mind is that all variables should be declared with the `let` keyword instead of int, double, or String.
